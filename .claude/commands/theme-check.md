# Theme System Check

Analyze the current theme implementation and verify:

1. **Theme Structure**: Check that all theme files are properly organized in lib/core/theme/
2. **Color Scheme**: Verify ColorScheme includes all required Material 3 colors
3. **Typography**: Ensure TextTheme is complete with Montserrat for headings and Inter for body
4. **Component Themes**: Check that all major components have custom theme data
5. **Extensions**: Verify custom theme extensions are properly implemented
6. **Usage**: Scan codebase for hardcoded values that should use theme tokens
7. **Consistency**: Check for any deviations from the design system

Provide a summary of findings and recommendations for improvements.
